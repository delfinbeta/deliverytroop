# jQuery PrintArea

Use `bower install` to install dependencies for the demo or development

You can specify 2 modes of printing:

- IFRAME-mode
- Popup-mode

Other options were added as the need arose, such as adding css to the page printed document, retaining attributes of the source element, adding elements to the head of the document printed and specifying several predefined document standards (the default is html5), even the popup was not part of the original plan.

### IFRAME-mode
IFRAME-mode is unobtrusive while popup mode opens a separate browser window.

### Popup-mode
Popup mode allows for the option of leaving the window open or automatically closing after printing.
