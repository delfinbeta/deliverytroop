PrintArea is a plugin designed to print specified areas of a web page.  

Earlier versions of this plugin did not have a license agreement, and were originally published on the old jquery website 
in their plugin repository. I did not immediately transfer the project to github and some of my older versions are not 
available here, but I have found some older versions in other repositories and still have the original ~50 lines of code. 

You can use this plugin as you wish, but please do not add versions of the plugin to public repositories without
pointing back to this project!
